# LWT2 (Learning With Texts 2)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3. This back-end is a flask server, depending on [Flask-Restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flask-PyMongo](https://flask-pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Development server
First, start the back-end server by running `python server/server.py`. The server was tested using Python 3.6.3. Run `ng serve` to run the Angular dev-server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## About LWT2 ##
Learning With Texts 2 (LWT) is a language learning tool that aims to help people learn new languages by reading texts. This is a new version created as a personal hobby project, based off the [original version](http://lwt.sourceforge.net/). While the concept of this application is the same, it is a complete re-write (meaning no code was used from the original version) and the feature-set, while similar, will not be identical.
